    "## 1 Domain-specific area and objectives of the project \n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen domain for this report is financial markets, in particular, tracking one of the most popular commodity and a form of currency, **gold**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gold has been used as a form of currency and a store of value for centuries[1]. Its historical significance as a medium of exchange as well as symbol of wealth has contributed to its enduring role in finance. Gold is actively traded on daily basis on various global exchanges. Traders buy and sell gold futures contracts to speculate on its future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gold is incorporated into various financial instruments, such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and gold-backed securities[2]. These instruments allow commercial and retail investors to gain exposure to gold prices without physically owning the metal. It also helps to fight against inflation, as gold supply cannot be artificially inflated like fiat currencies[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as being a financial instrument to invest in and generate wealth, gold is often considered a \"safe haven\" asset. During times of economic uncertainty or political instability, people tend to flee towards gold as a store of value. Why? Gold is perceived as a stable and reliable asset that can retain its worth in challenging economic conditions. It can be said that people's perception and ideologies towards gold contributes to the metal's value as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what gold is and why people value it, we can understand why **Machine Learning (ML)** can come into place here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A linear regression model can help us predict the future price of gold**. It can give investors an indicator of whether their asset will appreciate or depreciate in the coming future. It can also provide a general consensus of the public's view on gold, as declining gold prices could indicate a disinterest in gold as a commodity, as its demand may be dropping. *Though there are several factors the affect the price of gold*, using historical gold price data is a valid method of predicting its future price. There are already algorithms and trading bots being used by traders that utilize ML to make trades based of historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a model that will give us a prediction to future gold prices, which can be use to aid in our decision-making process of whether to add gold to our investment portfolio, or to liquidate it, as well as visualizing the price change over the decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this project may offer both academic and practical insights into the precious metals markets."
